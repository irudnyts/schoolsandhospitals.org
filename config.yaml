    title: What makes us different from other funds?
    features:
    - title: Full transperancy
      text: We are an independent non-governmental fund, that is not linked to any Ukrainian institution (our fund is to be registered in Germany). That makes us prone to any kind of corruption. Our team works for top world companies and institutions, which makes us credible. Further, we provide all receipts and transactions by request to our contributors.
    - title: End-to-end solutions
      text: We cover the full chain of reconstruction -- from collecting donations to delivering and installing equipment. We focus on targeted investments and define current critical needs. Some hospitals need windows to be replaced, and some schools require new internal furniture. We provide tangible yet feasible help.
    - title: Acknowledgments
      text: We value your contribution and acknowledge it by every possible means. We will install an engraved plaque with the name of the donator into every object that was bought by your donation. It is important for us that you feel your contribution.
