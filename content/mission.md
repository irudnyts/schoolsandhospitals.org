### Introduction

On February 24, 2022, Russia has launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. Despite false claims by the Russian government that only military objects will be targeted, the Russian army intentionally shelled and killed civilians. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 1'834 civilian casualties in the country (691 killed and 1'143 injured)[^1]. As of March 14, Mariupol alone lost 2'357 human lives[^2] according to Mariupol City Council. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine reported the death of 500 civilians in Kharkiv[^3]. The Prosecutor's General Office of Ukraine announced that **97 children were killed**. There is no other word than **genocide** to describe these war crimes.

The horror and terror of war does not stop here. Due to the war, 2.5 million of people are forced to leave their homes, mostly woman and children. Approximately 600 civilians buildings[^1], almost 50 schools[^2], and 22 kindergardens[^3] are fully or partially destroyed. In Kharkiv alone. The entire city's infrastructure is wiped out. It means that there is **no place to come back**.

Unfortunately, the war is not over yet. The humanity is still fighting with the terror, but we truly believe that the victory is not far. However, after the victory, challenging times will come -- 2.5 million people will come back to the cities that are practically annihilated. Ukrainian economy is drained right now due to war and requires some help outside.

We strongly believe that every single Ukrainian individual should have access to healthcare facilities, and every single Ukrainian child should have access to education system.

### What we do?

The purpose of this fund is rebuild schools and hospitals in Kharkiv, Ukraine. In order to make this process efficient, we tend to cover the entire cycle of operations:

* Defining where the help needed (based on visual evidences and requests from authorities)
* Collecting donations
* Dealing with private Ukrainian vendors (e.g., construction companies, architecture firms, artists)
*
