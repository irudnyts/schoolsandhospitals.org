This fund was started by [Iegor Rudnytskyi, PhD](https://irudnyts.github.io). Iegor is a self-employed data scientist, who previously taught various courses in data science and machine learning at University of Lausanne and EPFL Extension School. He is still a visiting lecturer at University of Lausanne. You can verify his identity by visiting his profile on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irudnyts/), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/irudnyts), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/irudnyts), and [GitHub](https://github.com/irudnyts) or contacting anyone from his virtual network.

Iegor was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine and, went to school #133, Lyceum of Art. He obtained his BSc and MSc in applied mathematics at National Technical University “Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute” and V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University. Before moving to Switzerland, he lived 22 years of his life in Kharkiv. In Switzerland, he obtained his MSc and PhD in actuarial science at University of Lausanne and has multiple peer-reviewed publications in insurance journals.

When the war has started, Iegor and his brother went to a Ukrainian/Polish border to volunteer. For six days, they helped 25 Ukrainians (including 10 kids) to get to the major Polish cities from the border. At that time, they realized that they can scale up their volunteering efforts since they both have major organizational skills. That's how they come up with [schoolsandhospitals.org](http://schoolsandhospitals.org/).

Iegor is currently building a team of his local friends in Kharkiv. Studying at Lyceum of Art gave him a powerful network of designers and architects, who are willing to volunteer for this project:

* [Kateryna Herasechkina](http://gray-archi.com.ua/)
* [Vasylysa Shchogoleva](http://vasi.work/about/)
