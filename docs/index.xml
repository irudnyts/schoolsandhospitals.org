Introduction On February 24, 2022, Russia has launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. Despite false claims by the Russian government that only military objects will be targeted, the Russian army intentionally shelled and killed civilians. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 1&#39;834 civilian casualties in the country (691 killed and 1&#39;143 injured)1. As of March 14, Mariupol alone lost 2&#39;357 human lives2 according to Mariupol City Council.</description>
