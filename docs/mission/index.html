      <p>LAST UPDATED: April 3, 2022</p>
<h2 id="our-story">Our story</h2>
<p>On February 24, 2022, Russia has launched a full-scale war against Ukraine. Due to the war, 4 million Ukrainians were forced to leave their homes and flee<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, mostly women and children. Approximately 600<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> civilians buildings, almost 60 schools<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, 30 kindergardens, and 8 hospitals are fully or partially destroyed. In Kharkiv alone. The entire city&rsquo;s infrastructure is wiped out and it means that there is <strong>no place to come back</strong>.</p>
<p>Our aim is to <em>restore</em> the critical social objects, namely <strong>schools and hospitals</strong>. When the war will be over, Ukrainians will come back to Ukraine, and we would love to make sure that Ukrainians will have access to all necessities to maintain a healthy life. We strongly believe that healthcare and educational facilities are essential and should be prioritized. We also believe that with a little help from our friends, this aim is more than feasible.</p>
<h2 id="our-focus">Our focus</h2>
<p>Not only the buildings were destroyed, but also everything inside them, for instance, class furniture and medical equipment. These elements (class desks, blackboards, examination tables) form the core infrastructure of schools and hospitals. Since we want to provide tangible yet feasible help, the focus of our fund is the infrastructure of schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>Let us give a concrete example. School #134 was burned to the ground (please see evidence on <a href="https://schoolsandhospitals.org/evidences/">this webpage</a>). This building had 21 classrooms<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, each of which could accommodate around 30 students. Therefore, the schools will need 21 classrooms X 30 seats / 2 seats per desk = 315 new desks. The average cost of a school desk in Ukraine is 30 euros. This yields a total estimated loss of 315 desks * 30 euros = 9'450 euros. Providing the schools with desks is a tangible help, and yet it is feasible to collect such an amount.</p>
<h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2>
<p>Our fund tend to cover the entire process: (1) we collect donations, (2) we estimate losses and document damages, (3) we contact authorities to define the critical needs, (4) we perform the research to find the most cost-effective options of items on the market, (5) we acquire items and deliver them to schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>Our priority is to maintain full transparency for our donators. We are not linked to any governmental institution, and therefore, immune to corruption. Further, all our transactions will be available by request to our donators in <a href="https://discord.gg/xksyyn4YuW">Discord</a>.</p>
<p>Each school and hospital was damaged differently, and we would like to make sure that we restore the most critical objects. That is why we ask volunteers to document the damages, so that we can inspect them, estimate losses, and define our priorities.</p>
<p>Finally, we are planning to acquire the necessary materials from the local Ukrainian companies. It will help us to support the local business.</p>
<h2 id="your-contribution">Your contribution</h2>
<p>You can contribute by various means, please visit our <a href="http://schoolsandhospitals.org/volunteer/">Getting involved</a> page for more information. We accept all kinds of contributions, and if you have domain expertise in school or medical equipment, it is very valuable for us. But let&rsquo;s come back to the main source of help.</p>
<p>Your donations are not just donations, it is so much more. When you donate, you do not just buy a desk for a school or an examination bed for a hospital. Instead, you jumpstart the entire Ukrainian economy and social sector. For instance, when we buy a desk with your donations, the company that produced that table has to pay an income tax to the Ukrainian government. A certain amount of this tax goes back to schools and hospitals from the government.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>We believe that it is extremely important to acknowledge our contributors and give credit to their kindness. First, all contributors will appear in <a href="https://schoolsandhospitals.org/contributors/">our list</a>. Second, for every bought equipment on your donations, we will install a plaque &ldquo;Donated by Your Name&rdquo;.</p>
